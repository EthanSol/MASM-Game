Controls:

    WS/UpDwn -
        Moves the player's vehicle forward and backward
    Left/Right Click -
        Spins (steers) the secondary sprite using RotateBlit.
        For some reason this tends to work better with a mouse
        than on a trackpad. Sometimes the mouse cursor and 
        buttons get "stuck" on screen with the trackpad. When
        using a mouse I have never encountered these problems
    P/Space - Pause/Unpause the game
=============================================================
Game Play:

    Drive the car around the field to collect coins. Collecting
    coins will increase your score and progress the level (difficulty)
    of the game until the maximum level (5). The level of the game
    also acts as a score multiplier. A coin at level 1 is worth 1000
    points while a coin at level 5 is worth 5000 points. There is also
    a special coin that flies around the screen faster than the player
    can move. If the player manages to collect this coin, they will
    get double the points of a regular coin, and also gain a speed boost
    until the next regular coin is collected.

    If the player collides with a bullet bill, the player dies and the
    game is over.

Game Features:
    
    Screens -
        There are four game states: Start, Play, Pause, Game over
        Each of these states has a different display, and different
        music. Any non-play screen has a number of buttons. These
        buttons get highlighted when the mouse is hovering over them.

    Multiple in-flight projectiles -
        The powerup coin and all the bullet bills fly around the
        screen randomly
    
    PowerUps - 
        The power up coin gives the player extra points and a
        temporarily increased speed.

    Complex Scoring System - 
        There are two different types of coins that give different
        score values. The level at which the player is playing is
        also a score multiplier.

    Sound/Music - 
        There is a menu sound and a game play sound. These get 
        played at the appropriate times. There is also a special sound
        played when the player's powerup is active.
    
    Special visual effect -
        The player's vehicle gets animated in a strobe pattern when the
        power up is activated.
